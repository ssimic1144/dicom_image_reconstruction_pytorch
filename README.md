# Image reconstruction with pytorch

The goal of this project is to create missing projection using 2 input projections (previous and next projection of targeted missing projection) ,obtained from DICOM file, using neural network, which will be implemented in Pytorch

## Current status of project

Current model does reconstruct image but it's still little bit blurry.
